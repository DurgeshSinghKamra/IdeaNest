      <h2>1. Idea Evaluation & Uniqueness</h2>
      <p>The idea of solar tracking panels is well-established in the solar industry. However, most available solutions cater to large-scale commercial or utility-based projects. Your proposed system — affordable solar tracking kits designed for small-scale users such as homeowners, schools, farms, and small businesses — targets an underserved market. Current solutions are either prohibitively expensive, inefficient, or limited to DIY setups without mainstream adoption. Thus, while the concept of solar tracking exists, your idea is unique in its target audience and affordability focus.</p>
